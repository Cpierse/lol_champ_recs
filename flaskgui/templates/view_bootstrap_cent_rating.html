  <h4> Questions:</h4>
  <h6> How are the recommendations calculated? </h6>
<!--   <p>
  If you enjoy playing champion X in role A (your selection), the algorithm will recommend you the top 3 champions in role B based on how many gold players play BOTH champion X in role A more than average and recommended champions in role B more than average. For the specifics, check out this <a href="http://cpierse.physics.ucsd.edu/champ_recs_post/"> post</a>.
  </p> -->
  <p>
  The algorithm is pretty straightforward &mdash; if a player plays champion X in role A (your selection) more than average and champion Y in role B (a possible recommendation) more than average, they would "recommend" champion Y to you. The three champions with the highest number of recomendations in each role are shown. For the specifics, check out this <a href="http://cpierse.physics.ucsd.edu/champ_recs_post/"> post</a>.
  </p>
  <h6> What is N? And what about the stars? </h6>
  <p>
  N is the number of players in the dataset who play enough games to make a recommendation for this role. The stars reflect how highly a specific champion is recommended to you for that role. A 3-star recommendation is an outstanding recommendation that is  statistically better than a 1- or 2-star recommendation. A 0-star recommendation still has a number of players recommending that champion, but the recommendation may not be statistically significant. 
  </p>
<!--   <h4> How did you collect the data? </h4>
  <p>
  Riot has a publicly available API that any developer can use to access game data. I found Gold-ranked players and recorded data from all of their 2016 ranked matches.
  </p> -->
  <h6> Why use data from Gold-ranked players? </h6>
  <p>
  Players at different ranks tend to choose different champions. Gold seems to offer a good balance of in-game skill (top 20% of all players) and off-meta champions (who plays Urgot in Challenger?).
  </p>
  <h6> Why does the champion I selected appear in multiple roles? </h6>
  <p>
  Recommendations for the same champion are included if that champion is played in another role. For example, the recommendations for top Quinn reveal that top-lane Quinn players are dedicated enough to also play Quinn in the mid, jungle, and adc roles. Along those same lines, top-lane Teemo players will play Teemo in any role except adc...
  </p>
<!--   <h4> Does this include data from the newest champions? </h4>
  <p>
  Nope! In fact, this data is from last season! It would be pretty cool to do a better version of this analysis on newer data.
  </p>
  <h4> Why are there so few recommendations for _____? </h4>
  <p>
  While I do have data from ~140k players, my algorithm only considers the subset of players who play both the selected champion X in role A and the recommended champion Y in role B more than average. Additionally, recommendations are only included if the player has: 1) played a minimum number of games in both roles, 2) played a minimum number of games on champion X in role A, and 3) played a minimum fraction of their games on champion X in role A. These restrictions help amplify the signal from players who main your role and your champion.
  </p>
   <h4> Technical question: why not just use the Pearson correlation? </h4>
  <p>
  The Pearson correlation is great, but it includes some data that might not be relevant. For example, if a player plays both champions X and Y less than average, this player's contribution to the sample Pearson correlation coefficient r would be positive (and hence, they would "recommend" Y to people who play X). This is not good. Additionally, a one- or two-trick pony who plays a champion significantly more than the average will have a larger contribution to r and would therefore skew the recommendations to their playstyle. The current method avoids both of these issues.
